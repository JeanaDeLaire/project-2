This project was completed for a full-stack development training course. Motivation to create this project originates in the idea that Rhode Island offers many obscure outdoor attractions. The state also has a lot of quirks. Who better to share these secrets than locals? This full-stack application is meant to be a place for many users to share resources and create a digital center for people to communicate about state attractions.

### Back-end Tech:

The database runs on Rails with a one to many relationship between users and sites. Each posted resource is a user owned entity and may only be edited and deleted by the original creator, or database manager.

### Front-end Tech:
The front-end utilizes HTML5, CSS and Bootstrap. Javascript and jQuery handle site interaction and help present data to users. Handlbars displays the
information from the database through a grid template. The searchbar filters through keywords through javascript and pushing in relevant matches into a new array which is passed through handlebars.

## User Stories
- As a user I should be able to sign up and sign in to create sites and comments.
- As a user I should be able to view all entries.
- As a user I should be able to edit my previous entries.

## Future Iterations and unsolved issues:

A few improvements that should be made will include clearning all forms, and ensuring that content sections that appear from Get requests hide when a user logs out.

Future versions of this app will add in a comment table to the database so that additional users can contribute to sites created by other users.
